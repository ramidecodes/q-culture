# Linting and Development Server Rules

## Available Lint Scripts

This project uses Biome for linting and formatting. The following scripts are available in `package.json`:

- **`pnpm lint`**: Runs Biome linter to check for code issues without making changes
- **`pnpm format`**: Formats code using Biome formatter (writes changes)
- **`pnpm check`**: Runs both linting and formatting checks, and applies fixes automatically (equivalent to `biome check --write .`)

## When to Use Lint Scripts

- **After making code changes**: Always run `pnpm lint` or `pnpm check` to validate code quality
- **Before committing**: Use `pnpm check` to ensure code is properly formatted and linted
- **When fixing linting errors**: Use `pnpm check` to automatically fix auto-fixable issues
- **For validation only**: Use `pnpm lint` when you only want to check for issues without making changes

## Development Server

**IMPORTANT**: The development server (`pnpm dev`) is **always** run manually by the user.

- **DO NOT** run `pnpm dev` from the agent terminal
- **DO NOT** attempt to start, stop, or manage the development server
- The user maintains full control over the development server lifecycle
- If you need to verify that code works, rely on:
  - TypeScript compilation (`pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`)
  - Linting (`pnpm lint` or `pnpm check`)
  - Build verification (`pnpm build`)

## Best Practices

1. After editing files, run `pnpm check` to ensure code quality
2. If linting fails, review the errors and fix them manually or let Biome auto-fix when possible
3. Never assume the development server needs to be restarted - the user handles this
4. Use build verification (`pnpm build`) to catch production build issues
